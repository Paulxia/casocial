Casocial is a new form of a casual social network at ease.
In established social networks like Facebook, StudiVZ or Twitter you have to create an account, upload a picture and start building your network. Casocial intentionally does without these features.

Just type a title and a description of your post and your done. Every post is automatically connected with your current location. While you browse posts you will alway find the closest occasions.
Find something interesting? Just hit reply and exchange messages.

Because you dont log into an account and post only live for a short time, you dont leave traces in the internet. No more embarrassing entries you cannot delete.

Today businesswoman, tomorrow party girl. Everything possible, no must-do. 

Making a garage sale, bored at the airport, looking for people to meet in a pub or just want to tell a new joke. Just post in Casocial and you might get together.

This is the first release. Some important features will be in the next update.
* Map View: see the posts on a map.
* Push Notifications: receive message updates in the background.
* Localization: Casocial in your language.


The refresh button fetches posts in an area of 100 km.
Fetch More Posts fetches more posts, no matter how far away.
Post will be deleted after one month.

We are happy to hear any feedback from you!
